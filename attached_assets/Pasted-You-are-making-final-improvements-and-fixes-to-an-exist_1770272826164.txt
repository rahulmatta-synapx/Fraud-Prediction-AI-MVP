You are making final improvements and fixes to an existing MVP Fraud Prediction AI Agent project (React frontend + Azure Functions Python/FastAPI backend) for UK Motor Insurance.

Apply these exact changes:

1. After submitting a claim → Claim Detail page must be **read-only forever**:
   - Remove all editing fields, Save & Rescore button, override card/section.
   - Show clear label: "Read-only - Submitted claims cannot be edited"
   - When user clicks Submit on Submit New Claim page → show confirmation modal:
     - Text: "You can never change this claim once submitted. Please double-check all fields, extracted data, and documents."
     - Buttons: "Go Back" (cancel) and "Submit Anyway" (proceed)

2. On Submit New Claim page:
   - After upload → show **clear PDF/image preview** (use react-pdf for scrollable PDF viewer)
   - Preview appears next to or below form so user can easily cross-check AI-extracted values against original document before submit
   - Keep single file only + Remove button

3. Remove all override/rescore logic completely:
   - Delete override card, rescore button, related endpoints/code
   - No editing after submit — fields are locked forever

4. Dashboard improvements:
   - Revert "All Claims" UI to previous simple table/list style (not cards if you changed it)
   - Make entire row/claim entry **clickable** (not just arrow) → opens Claim Detail
   - Show useful data in list: Claim ID, Fraud Score (big, color-coded), Risk Band badge, Status badge, Claim Amount (£), Accident Type, Submission Date, Claimant or Vehicle Reg

5. Fix unnecessary "Field Edited" logs:
   - In submit logic → when comparing AI-extracted vs final values:
     - Normalize numbers (e.g. Number("18500") === Number("18500.0") → no log)
     - Only log FIELD_EDIT if actual value differs after conversion
     - Ignore type-only changes (string vs float/int)

6. Statuses & badges:
   - Only use: "Needs Review" (yellow, default after submit), "Approved" (green), "Rejected" (red)
   - Remove "Rescored" badge/status (no rescore anymore)
   - Show badge prominently in Claim Detail and Dashboard list

7. Add Approve / Reject back to Claim Detail page:
   - After review → show Approve and Reject buttons
   - Each requires mandatory reason (dropdown: "Low risk confirmed", "Evidence supports", "High risk – SIU referral", "Insufficient evidence", "Other") + notes textarea
   - Approve → status = "Approved"
   - Reject → status = "Rejected"
   - Log APPROVE/REJECT in audit with user, timestamp, reason/notes
   - Human can approve high-risk or reject low-risk — no enforcement

8. Statistics page:
   - Make it functional — show real aggregated data from Cosmos DB:
     - Total Claims
     - High Risk count
     - Needs Review count
     - Approved / Rejected count
     - Decisions Made (Approved + Rejected)
     - Average fraud score
     - Claims this month / last 24h
   - Use simple charts (recharts or basic divs) if possible

9. High Risk Claims page:
   - Filter and show **only** claims with risk band "High" (score >60)
   - Same clickable list as All Claims

10. Justification / Explanation layer:
    - Replace current thin signals with structured, professional justification
    - Call Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1 with this exact system prompt (add as constant in ai_service.py):
      """
      You are a claims review summarization assistant for a UK motor insurer.
      Your role is to explain, in neutral and professional language, WHY this claim has been assigned its current risk classification, based on:
      - Factual claim data
      - AI-generated observations
      - Deterministic rules triggered by the system
      IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
      - You do NOT determine fraud.
      - You do NOT recommend denial or approval.
      - You do NOT speculate beyond provided data.
      - You must clearly separate facts, observations, and system logic.
      - Use insurer-appropriate language suitable for audit, regulator review, or court disclosure.
      INPUTS:
      1. Claim summary (JSON of fields)
      2. AI signals
      3. Triggered rules with weights
      4. Final fraud score and risk band
      YOUR TASK:
      Produce structured JSON explaining:
      - What factual elements stood out
      - Which system rules were triggered and why
      - How these factors contributed to the assigned risk band
      - What aspects may warrant closer human review (if any)
      OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON):
      {
        "risk_overview": {
          "risk_band": "low | medium | high",
          "fraud_score": number,
          "system_interpretation": "Neutral explanation of what this score represents"
        },
        "key_factors": [
          {
            "type": "Rule | AI Observation | Claim Data",
            "name": "Short label",
            "explanation": "Plain-English explanation grounded in evidence"
          }
        ],
        "analyst_guidance": {
          "review_focus": ["Specific aspects an analyst may want to verify"],
          "missing_or_uncertain_information": ["Any gaps or ambiguities in the available data"]
        },
        "confidence_note": "Brief note on system confidence and limitations"
      }
      Tone: Neutral, Professional, Non-accusatory, Suitable for internal audit review
      Return ONLY valid JSON.
      """
    - Show this justification in Claim Detail under "AI Justification" or "Risk Explanation" section (parse JSON → render nicely)

Output:
- Step-by-step changes
- Updated code blocks for:
  - frontend/src/pages/SubmitClaim.tsx (confirmation modal + PDF preview)
  - frontend/src/pages/ClaimDetail.tsx (read-only, approve/reject, justification render)
  - frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (revert list style, clickable rows, useful fields)
  - backend/services/ai_service.py (new justification prompt call)
  - backend/routers/claims.py (approve/reject endpoints, status update)
  - Any schema or audit fixes
- Test steps: submit claim → confirm modal → see read-only detail → approve/reject → check badge + audit + justification

Generate the final updates now — make it polished, intuitive, auditable, and demo-ready.
