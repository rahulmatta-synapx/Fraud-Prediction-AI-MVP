You are fixing and improving an existing MVP Fraud Prediction AI Agent (UK Motor Insurance only) built with Azure Functions (Python + FastAPI) backend and React (Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui) frontend.

Current issues to fix:
1. When uploading a document in the "Submit New Claim" page, getting this error:
   "Extraction Warning
   Error code: 404 - {'error': {'code': 'DeploymentNotFound', 'message': 'The API deployment for this resource does not exist. If you created the deployment within the last 5 minutes, please wait a moment and try again.'}}"

   This happens in the backend when calling Azure OpenAI GPT-4o vision (Responses API). Likely wrong deployment name in code or deployment not fully ready. Fix it by:
   - Using the correct deployment name (assume it's "gpt-4o" or prompt user to confirm secret)
   - Add retry logic (wait + retry 2–3 times on 404)
   - Better error handling: show user-friendly message like "AI model is starting up – please try again in 1–2 minutes" instead of raw 404

2. Currently allows multiple document uploads per claim — change to **only one document** allowed.
   - If user tries to add a second file, show error message: "Sorry, only one document is allowed per claim entry. Remove the current file first if needed."
   - Disable the upload button after one file is selected.

3. Add a **remove uploaded document** feature:
   - After a file is uploaded/selected, show a preview (filename + small thumbnail if image) + "Remove" button (trash icon).
   - Clicking Remove clears the file from state, re-enables upload button, and removes any temp base64 / preview.

Other requirements (keep enforcing from previous):
- Motor insurance only with exact fields (Claimant Name, Policy ID, etc.)
- GPT-4o vision for single-file extraction & auto-fill
- Cosmos DB persistence, 3 users (Jake, Rahul, Navsheen) with simple login/JWT
- Audit logging with user names
- Blob Storage for the uploaded file (store path in claim record)

Detailed fixes to implement:
1. Backend (/extract-fields endpoint):
   - Fix OpenAI call: use correct deployment name from secret (e.g. os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT") or hardcode "gpt-4o" if known)
   - Add retry decorator (e.g. tenacity) for 404 errors with 5–10s wait
   - Limit to one file: if multiple files sent, reject with 400 error "Only one document allowed per claim"
   - Return clear JSON error for frontend

2. Frontend (SubmitClaim page):
   - Change file input to single file only (<input type="file" multiple={false} />)
   - Use state for single file: const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null)
   - On file change: read as base64, send to /extract-fields, auto-fill form
   - If file already selected: disable input or show message "Only one document allowed. Remove current file to change."
   - Show uploaded file preview: filename + small image preview (if PDF, show icon or first page) + "Remove" button
   - On remove: setSelectedFile(null), clear preview, re-enable input, clear extracted fields if needed

3. UI/UX improvements:
   - Add loading spinner during extraction
   - User-friendly error toast/message for 404 / model not ready
   - Validation: disable "Submit" button until file uploaded + all required fields filled

Output:
- Updated code blocks for:
  - backend/routers/claims.py (or wherever /extract-fields is) – fix OpenAI call + single file check
  - frontend/src/pages/SubmitClaim.tsx (or component) – single file handling, remove button, preview, error messages
- Instructions: "Confirm your GPT-4o deployment name in Azure Portal (Deployments blade) and add to secrets as AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT if different from 'gpt-4o'"
- How to test: login, go to submit claim, upload one PDF → see auto-fill, try second file → see error, remove file → upload new one
