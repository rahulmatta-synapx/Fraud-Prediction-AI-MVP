You are refactoring and completing an existing MVP Fraud Prediction AI Agent project (React frontend + Azure Functions Python/FastAPI backend) to make the claim workflow more logical and production-ready.

Current problem:
- "Override Risk Score" is illogical — user can enter any random number without justification.
- No proper Approve/Reject flow after review.
- No clear claim status/badges (e.g. "Needs Review" after creation).
- Claim status should evolve: New → Needs Review → Rescored/Edited → Approved / Rejected.

New logic to implement exactly:
- After claim creation/submit → status = "Needs Review" (badge: yellow "Needs Review")
- In Claim Detail page:
  - Show current score, rules triggered, extracted fields, documents, audit history
  - Allow user to **edit any field** (e.g. correct Policy ID, update description, add notes on new evidence)
  - Replace old "Override Score" with **Save & Rescore** button:
    - When clicked → re-run rules engine on updated fields → calculate new score + risk band
    - Show new score + triggered rules + "Rescored" badge (orange)
    - Log RESCORE action in audit (old score → new score, user, timestamp, changed fields)
  - After review/rescore → show **Approve** and **Reject** buttons:
    - Approve: sets status to "Approved" (green badge), requires reason/notes (e.g. "Low risk confirmed", "Evidence supports")
    - Reject: sets status to "Rejected" (red badge), requires reason/notes (e.g. "High risk – SIU referral", "Insufficient evidence")
    - User can Approve high-risk or Reject low-risk — no enforcement
    - Log APPROVE or REJECT in audit with reason/notes
- Badges / Statuses (color-coded in UI):
  - Needs Review (yellow) → default after creation
  - Rescored (orange) → after Save & Rescore
  - Approved (green)
  - Rejected (red)
- Status stored in claim record (add "status" field: string enum)
- All actions (edit fields, rescore, approve/reject) → fully logged in audit-logs with user name, timestamp, details (old/new values, reason)

Keep existing:
- Motor insurance fields only
- GPT-4.1 vision extraction on upload
- Single file upload + remove
- 3 users (Jake, Rahul, Navsheen) with simple login/JWT
- Cosmos DB persistence (claims + audit-logs)
- Blob Storage for docs
- Current rules engine (update if needed, but keep weights/thresholds)

Tasks:
1. Update backend:
   - Add status field to Claim schema (enum: Needs Review, Rescored, Approved, Rejected)
   - New endpoints or update PUT /claims/{id}:
     - PATCH fields → save changes → optional rescore on demand
     - POST /claims/{id}/rescore → re-run rules → update score/band/status="Rescored"
     - POST /claims/{id}/approve → status="Approved" + reason/notes
     - POST /claims/{id}/reject → status="Rejected" + reason/notes
   - Log every action in audit-logs (user, timestamp, action_type, details)

2. Update frontend ClaimDetail.tsx:
   - Show badge based on status (color-coded pill)
   - Editable fields (inputs/selects) for all claim data
   - Save & Rescore button → call rescore endpoint → refresh UI with new score
   - Approve / Reject buttons with modal for reason/notes (dropdown + textarea)
   - Disable Approve/Reject until reviewed (or always allow — human decides)

3. Add Help/Manual page (if not already) explaining:
   - How to review/edit/rescore
   - Approve/Reject meaning (human final decision)
   - Status badges meaning

Output:
- Step-by-step changes
- Updated code blocks for:
  - backend/routers/claims.py (new endpoints: rescore, approve, reject)
  - backend/services/rules_engine.py (if any tweak)
  - frontend/src/pages/ClaimDetail.tsx (editable fields, buttons, badge)
  - Any schema updates (claim status)
- Test steps: create claim → see "Needs Review" → edit field → Save & Rescore → see new score → Approve/Reject → check audit log

Generate the updates now — make it intuitive, auditable, and fully human-controlled.
